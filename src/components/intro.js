                <span>I have been working as a Mobile Application Developer for 6 years with 20+ apps live in AppStore and Google PlayStore. I have developed these applications using native Android and iOS technologies. I am enthusiastic about the technical aspects of application development and very passionate about coding. I am very keen on learning new programming languages and emerging technologies. I have integrated various libraries and SDKs.<br></br> I love working on React Native which is my currentÂ thrill. I have developed a few applications using React Native and look forward to more. Having worked on various freelance projects as well has helped me gain a broader perspective and better understanding of the nuances of the software development life cycle.
I'm also learning Back-End Development and looking forward to being a Full Stack Developer.</span>
